## Overview

Paywint uses webhooks to notify your platform when key events occur â€” such as user KYC changes, KYB reviews, wallet activity, or card uploads.

This guide helps you implement and test your webhook endpoint to receive and respond to these real-time notifications.

## Webhook Events

You may receive webhook notifications for the following event types:

| Category | Event Type |
|----------|------------|
| KYC | `kyc.applied`<br />`kyc.approved`<br />`kyc.rejected`<br />`kyc.failed`<br />`kyc.completed` |
| KYB | `kyb.approved`<br />`kyb.rejected` |
| Wallet | `wallet.funded`<br />`wallet.withdrawn` |
| Card | `card.added`<br />`card.images_uploaded` |

Each event will be sent to the webhook URL configured on your platform account.

## Webhook Payload Format

Each webhook is sent as a `POST` request with the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "event": "kyc.completed",
  "id": "a891bfc2-ffff-464b-89e4-xxxxx",
  "status": "completed",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific payload
  },
  "eventGeneratedTime": 1718006400.0
