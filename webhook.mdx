## Overview

This page explains how to set up and use webhooks.

To begin, you must configure a single URL endpoint that will receive `POST` requests. This endpoint should be hosted on a server you control and be capable of processing incoming webhook payloads.

All webhook events—such as `initiated`, `processing`, `success`, `failed`, and `rejected`—will be sent to the configured URL.

## Where To Setup

### Sandbox

Use the **Sandbox environment** to test your webhook setup before moving to production.

1. **Create a Sandbox Account:**  
   Sign up for a Sandbox account to start testing your integration.

2. **Get API Key:**  
   Go to the [Developer Panel → API Key](https://sandbox.app.paywint.com/app/developer-panel/api-credentials) section to generate your Sandbox API key.

3. **Configure Webhook URLs:**  
   In the [Developer Panel → Redirect/Webhook](https://sandbox.app.paywint.com/app/developer-panel/urls) section, you’ll find fields to enter your test endpoint:
   - **Webhook URL:**  
     The endpoint that receives specific event webhooks for payment status updates (e.g., `payment.success`, `payment.failed`).  
     Example: `https://example.com/webhook`

### Production

Once your Sandbox testing is complete, you can move to the **Production environment**.

Before enabling your Production setup, please contact our [support team](https://paywint.com/contact) to ensure your API and webhook configurations are properly activated.

1. **Create a Production Account:**  
Sign up for a Production account.

2. **Enable Production Access:**  
   Contact our [support team](https://paywint.com/contact) to request activation of your Production API and webhook setup.

3. **Get API Key:**  
Go to the [Developer Panel → API Keys](https://app.paywint.com/app/developer-panel/api-credentials) section to obtain your Production API key.

4. **Configure Webhook URLs:**
  In the [Developer Panel → Redirect/Webhook](https://app.paywint.com/app/developer-panel/urls) section, enter your live endpoint:
  - **Webhook URL:**  
    The live endpoint that receives real-time payment event webhooks.  
    Example: `https://yourapp.com/webhook`

5. **Support Contacts:**  
If you need assistance during setup:

## Basic Structure

| Field                | Description                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `event`              | The type of event that occurred (e.g., `payment.success`). |
| `id`                 | A unique identifier for this webhook delivery.            |
| `data`               | The event-specific payload object.                        |
| `eventGeneratedTime` | UNIX timestamp (in seconds) when the event was generated. |

Example payload:

```json
{
  "event": "payment.success",
  "id": "a891bfc2-ffff-464b-89e4-xxxxx",
  "data": {
    "payment_id": "b91a0f36-b10b-4a31-ae12-e8b4c5ee71f4",
    "status": "success",
    "amount": 599
  },
  "eventGeneratedTime": 1718006400.0
}
```

## Delivery & Retry Behavior

If your webhook endpoint fails to return a `2xx` HTTP response, Paywint will automatically retry delivery up to **two more times**, for a total of **three attempts** per event.

* Retries are sent within a predefined timeframe.
* If all three attempts fail, Paywint will notify your **email** with details of the failed event.

> **Note:** To avoid missed events, ensure your webhook endpoint is highly available and returns `200 OK` quickly. Any internal processing should happen asynchronously to avoid missed events.
