## Overview

This page explains how to set up and use webhooks.

To begin, you must configure a single URL endpoint that will receive `POST` requests. This endpoint should be hosted on a server you control and be capable of processing incoming webhook payloads.

All webhook events—such as `initiated`, `processing`, `success`, `failed`, and `rejected`—will be sent to the configured URL.

## Webhook Events

Below is the list of webhook events sent by Paywint.

| Event Name                    | Description                            |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `payment.initiated`           | Payment was initiated.                 |
| `payment.processing`          | Payment is being processed.            |
| `payment.success`             | Payment was successful.                |
| `payment.failed`              | Payment failed.                        |
| `payment.rejected`            | Payment was rejected.                  |


## Basic Structure

| Field                | Description                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `event`              | The type of event that occurred (e.g., `kyc.applied`).    |
| `id`                 | A unique identifier for this webhook delivery.            |
| `data`               | The event-specific payload object.                        |
| `eventGeneratedTime` | UNIX timestamp (in seconds) when the event was generated. |

Example payload:

```json
{
  "event": "kyc.applied",
  "id": "a891bfc2-ffff-464b-89e4-xxxxx",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific payload
  },
  "eventGeneratedTime": 1718006400.0
}
````

## Delivery & Retry Behavior

If your webhook endpoint fails to return a `2xx` HTTP response, Paywint will automatically retry delivery up to **two more times**, for a total of **three attempts** per event.

* Retries are sent within a predefined timeframe.
* If all three attempts fail, Paywint will notify your **email** with details of the failed event.

> **Note:** To avoid missed events, ensure your webhook endpoint is highly available and returns `200 OK` quickly. Any internal processing should happen asynchronously to avoid missed events.
