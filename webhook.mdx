## Overview

Paywint uses webhooks to notify your platform when key events occur â€” such as user KYC changes, KYB reviews, wallet activity, or card uploads.

This guide helps you implement and test your webhook endpoint to receive and respond to these real-time notifications.

## Webhook Events

You may receive webhook notifications for the following event types:

| Category | Event Type |
|----------|------------|
| Payment | `payment.initiated`<br />`payment.processing`<br />`payment.failed`<br />`payment.approved`<br />`payment.rejected` |

Each event will be sent to the webhook URL configured on your platform account.

## Webhook Payload Format

Each webhook is sent as a `POST` request with the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "event": "payment.initiated",
  "id": "a891bfc2-ffff-464b-89e4-xxxxx",
  "webhook_status": "completed",  // or "delivered"
  "data": {
    // Event-specific payload
  },
  "eventGeneratedTime": 1718006400.0
}
