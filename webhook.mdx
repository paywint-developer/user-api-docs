## Overview

Paywint uses webhooks to notify your platform when key events occur — such as user KYC changes, KYB reviews, wallet activity, or card uploads.

This guide helps you implement and test your webhook endpoint to receive and respond to these real-time notifications.

---

## Webhook Events

You may receive webhook notifications for the following event types:

| Category | Event Type |
|----------|------------|
| Payment | `payment.initiated`<br />`payment.processing`<br />`payment.success`<br />`payment.failed`<br />`payment.rejected`<br />`payment.refunded`<br />`payment.processing_fee_refunded` |

Each event will be sent to the webhook URL configured on your platform account.

## Webhook Payload Format

Each webhook is sent as a `POST` request with the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "event": "kyc.applied",
  "id": "a891bfc2-ffff-464b-89e4-xxxxx",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific payload
  },
  "eventGeneratedTime": 1718006400.0
}
````

* `event`: Type of the event that occurred.
* `id`: Unique identifier for this webhook delivery.
* `data`: Event-specific payload object.
* `eventGeneratedTime`: UNIX timestamp (in seconds) when the event was generated.

---

## Delivery & Retry Behavior

If your webhook endpoint fails to acknowledge an event (i.e., does not return a `2xx` HTTP response), Paywint will automatically retry delivery up to **two more times**, for a total of **three attempts** per event.

* All retries are sent within a predefined timeframe.
* If all three attempts fail, Paywint will notify your account’s **email** with details of the failed event.

> **Note:** To avoid missed events, ensure your webhook endpoint is highly available and returns `200 OK` quickly, even if internal processing happens asynchronously.
