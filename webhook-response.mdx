## Webhook Structure

Every webhook payload shares the same top-level structure:

<ResponseField name="event" type="string">
  The event name indicating what happened
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="id" type="string">
  Unique event identifier (UUID v4 format)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="data" type="object">
  Event-specific fields containing relevant information
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="eventGeneratedTime" type="float">
  UNIX timestamp in seconds when the event was generated
</ResponseField>

# Payment Status Webhooks

Paywint sends webhook events to notify your application about payment status changes. This allows you to keep your system synchronized with payment updates in real-time.

## Payment Events



### Payment Opened

Sent when a payment link has been opened by as user to initiate payment.

```json

  "event": "payment.opened",
  "id": "60a71435-d079-4126-81a2-1977bb70a306",
  "data": {
    "payment_id": "a5299046-1f62-4f78-8239-6e724d99c38b",
    "status": "opened",
    "amount": 599
  },
  "eventGeneratedTime": 1756717250.451172
}
```


### Payment Processing

Sent when a payment requires additional processing time or manual review.

```json
{
  "event": "payment.processing",
  "id": "b0ec03ca-822d-44fd-9407-de48a92a09a6",
  "data": {
    "payment_id": "5cd7a3c1-4b45-4148-b383-299553699745",
    "status": "processing",
    "amount": 599
  },
  "eventGeneratedTime": 1756452761.422979
}
```


### Payment Succeeded

Sent when a payment is successfully processed and completed.

```json
{
  "event": "payment.success",
  "id": "99036bd3-a8b2-403c-867c-3d03dafbe4b7",
  "data": {
    "payment_id": "b91a0f36-b10b-4a31-ae12-e8b4c5ee71f4",
    "status": "success",
    "amount": 599
  },
  "eventGeneratedTime": 1756451608.069325
}
```


### Payment Failed

Sent when a payment attempt fails due to various reasons such as insufficient funds or gateway rejections.

```json
{
  "event": "payment.failed",
  "id": "77b568f8-cc38-4b5c-91aa-ac3c77020963",
  "data": {
    "payment_id": "ac4bedda-f370-4ac4-a61e-e1761a5a51b9",
    "status": "failed",
    "amount": 599,
    "failed_reason": "Transaction could not be processed. Try again later."
  },
  "eventGeneratedTime": 1756452659.868249
}
```

### Payment Retried

Sent when a payment attempt fails and the user initiates a retry. Note that retrying creates a new payment transaction, which is why a `retry_payment_id` is provided for reference.

```json
{
  "event": "payment.retried",
  "id": "21b88258-9ff7-4a45-b2e3-85fe33709055",
  "data": {
    "payment_id": "998613a7-df7b-4f56-9297-b49a31e183d9",
    "status": "retried",
    "retry_payment_id": "ac4bedda-f370-4ac4-a61e-e1761a5a51b9",
    "amount": 33
  },
  "eventGeneratedTime": 1756452627.595624
}
```

### Payment Rejected

Sent when a payment is rejected due to policy violations.

```json
{
  "event": "payment.rejected",
  "id": "12345678-9abc-def0-1234-56789abcdef0",
  "data": {
    "payment_id": "472a27f5-5e1a-42b6-b61c-8a8c6d35a877",
    "status": "rejected",
    "amount": 599,
  },
  "eventGeneratedTime": 1756375999.456789
}
```


### Payment Expired

Sent when a payment link can no longer be used because it has passed its expiry. No further payment attempts can be initiated against this link; users must request a new link (which will create a new payment).

```json
{
  "event": "payment.expired",
  "id": "60a71435-d079-4126-81a2-1977bb70a306",
  "data": {
    "payment_id": "a5299046-1f62-4f78-8239-6e724d99c38b",
    "status": "expired",
    "amount": 599
  },
  "eventGeneratedTime": 1756717250.451172
}
```

## Handling Webhooks

### Best Practices

1. **Acknowledge quickly**: Return a 200 HTTP status code as soon as possible
2. **Process asynchronously**: Handle the actual business logic in background jobs
3. **Implement idempotency**: Use the event `id` to prevent duplicate processing



<Warning>
Webhook endpoints must respond with a 2xx HTTP status code within 30 seconds. Failed deliveries will be retried with exponential backoff.
</Warning>
