When someone makes a payment using Paywint Checkout, they are taken to Paywint’s secure checkout page.
After the payment attempt is finished—whether it succeeds or fails—Paywint automatically **redirects the customer back to your website**.

This is called a **Redirect**, and it’s how your site knows the result of the payment so you can show the appropriate message.

---

## How It Works

1. Your customer clicks “Pay” in your app or website.  
2. Paywint opens its secure checkout page.  
3. The customer chooses a payment method and completes the process.  
4. When the payment finishes, Paywint **redirects the customer back to the page you chose** (your “Callback URL”).  
5. Paywint adds two small pieces of information to the web address when sending them back:  

   * `id`: the unique Paywint payment number  
   * `status`: the result of the payment (`success`, `failed`, or `rejected`)  

That’s it—the customer is now back on your site, and you know what happened with their payment.

---

## Example Redirects

After a payment, Paywint might send the customer back to your site like this:

```text
https://yourapp.com/checkout/result?status=success&id=pay_9f3a2c
https://yourapp.com/checkout/result?status=failed&id=pay_9f3a2c
````

Notice the extra `id` and `status` at the end of the web address. You can use these values to decide what message to show your customer.

## What the Status Means

| Status     | What it means for the payment              | What you might show your customer                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `success`  | The payment went through.                  | “Payment successful! Thank you for your order.”      |
| `failed`   | The payment did not go through.            | “Something went wrong. Please try again.”            |

> Some payment methods may first show `processing`. This means the final result will come later. In those cases, your system should wait for confirmation (via webhook or checking the payment details in Paywint).

## Where to Set the Callback URL

You decide the page where customers should land after payment. This is called your **Callback URL**.

* **Sandbox (testing):**
  Go to [Sandbox Dashboard → URLs](https://sandbox.app.paywint.com/app/developer-panel/urls) and enter your page link,
  e.g. `https://sandbox.yourapp.com/checkout/result`.

* **Production (live):**
  Go to [Production Dashboard → URLs](https://app.paywint.com/app/developer-panel/urls) and enter your live page link,
  e.g. `https://yourapp.com/checkout/result`.

You can set different Callback URLs for Sandbox and Production. Just make sure the page exists in both environments.

---

## Why This Matters

* Redirects let your customers **come back to your app smoothly** after paying.
* You can immediately show them a confirmation screen (success, failure, or rejection).
* To be 100% sure of the final result, your system should also check Paywint’s webhook or fetch the payment details.

---

## Quick Setup

1. In your Paywint Dashboard, set your **Payment Callback URL** (the page where customers should land after payment).
2. Make sure this page can read the `status` and `id` from the web address.
3. Show your customer the right message based on the result.

That’s all—your customers always end up back in your app, and you can guide them to their next step.
