## Overview

For **payment flows**, Paywint can redirect customers back to your application using a **Callback URL**.  
This lets your frontend know the outcome of the payment attempt so you can display the appropriate result to the user.

At minimum, Paywint will include:

- `id`: the Paywint payment identifier  
- `status`: the outcome of the payment  

Your frontend should use these values to render confirmation, show error messages, or trigger client-side requests to fetch full details.

---

## Where To Setup

### Sandbox

To configure the **Sandbox Callback URL**:

1. Go to **[Sandbox Dashboard → URLs](https://sandbox.app.paywint.com/app/developer-panel/urls)**.
2. Under **Payment Callback URL**, enter the absolute URL of your frontend page  
   (e.g., `https://sandbox.yourapp.com/checkout/result`).

### Production

To configure the **Production Callback URL**:

1. Go to **[Production Dashboard → URLs](https://app.paywint.com/app/developer-panel/urls)**.
2. Under **Payment Callback URL**, enter the absolute URL of your frontend page  
   (e.g., `https://yourapp.com/checkout/result`).

> You can set different Callback URLs for Sandbox and Production. Make sure your frontend route exists in both environments.

---

## Callback Flow

1. A customer attempts a payment on Paywint’s hosted page.
2. When the flow completes, Paywint redirects the browser to your configured **Callback URL**.
3. Query parameters are appended to the URL so your frontend can read the payment result.
4. (Recommended) Your page then calls your backend to fetch authoritative details (or waits for the matching **webhook** event).

---

## Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                 |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `id`      | string | The Paywint payment ID.                     |
| `status`  | string | Outcome of the payment. See below for values |

### Example Callback Redirects

```text
https://yourapp.com/checkout/result?id=pay_9f3a2c&status=success
https://yourapp.com/checkout/result?id=pay_9f3a2c&status=failed
````

---

## Possible Status Values

The `status` reflects the result at **callback time**:

| Status     | When it occurs                                                  | Typical Next Step                        |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `success`  | The payment was completed successfully.                         | Show success UI; verify server-side.     |
| `failed`   | The payment attempt failed (e.g., processor/issuer error).      | Show failure UI; allow retry.            |
| `rejected` | The payment was explicitly rejected (e.g., risk/manual review). | Show rejection UI; provide support path. |

> **Note:** Some payment methods settle asynchronously. A callback with `processing` may later resolve to `success` or `failed`. Use **webhooks** for the authoritative final state.

---

## Working With Webhooks

Callback URLs are **customer-facing** and immediate. Webhooks are **server-to-server** and reliable.
For the best experience:

1. **Render immediately** based on the `status` in the callback.
2. **Confirm** the final state server-side by:

   * Waiting for the matching webhook (recommended), or
   * Fetching the payment from Paywint via your backend.

See the **Webhooks** page for details.

---

## Testing Tips

* Use **Sandbox** to test different payment outcomes (`success`, `failed`).
* Manually append query strings in development (e.g., `?id=demo123&status=success`) to simulate results.
* Ensure your app handles **missing** or **unexpected** query parameters gracefully.

---

## Security & Integrity

* Treat query parameters as **untrusted input**. Do **not** mark an order as paid based only on the callback.
* Always rely on your backend verification (via webhook or API fetch) to finalize payment records.

---

## Example: Putting It All Together

1. Configure the **Payment Callback URL** in the Dashboard.
2. Build a frontend route (e.g., `/checkout/result`) to parse `id` and `status`.
3. On load, call your backend or wait for a webhook to confirm the payment’s final state.
4. Render success, failure, or rejection UI and guide the user to the next step (view order, retry, support).

That’s it — with the Callback URL, your users return smoothly to your app, while webhooks keep your system consistent.
