icon: "key"

**All API requests to Paywint must be made over HTTPS and authenticated using an API key.**
Include the API key in the request header as `X-Api-Key`, and  `X-Api-Secret`.

```curl Example Api Call
curl -X POST "https://<environment>/api/example" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Api-Secret: YOUR_API_SECRET" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "9876543210",
    "phone_country_code": "+1"
  }'

```

Make sure to use the correct API key for the appropriate [environment](/environments). Using the wrong key or URL may result in authentication failures.

Keep your API key secure and never expose it on the client side.
